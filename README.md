# Lucky-Admin

## 📌 Project Overview
Lucky admin is a web application that allows clients to place bets on draws and enables administrators to manage draws, track payments, and generate winner reports.

## 🚀 Functional Requirements (Beta) 

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- Admins must log in to access admin features.
- Clients must register before placing any bets.

### 🎯 Draw Management
- Admins can create a draw with a specific closing time.
- Draws auto-close at the configured time, and numbers are generated by the system.

### 💸 Bet Management
- Registered clients can place bets for a specific draw.
- Bets must be placed at least 24 hours before the draw closes.
- Admins can manually mark a bet as paid/unpaid (in-person payment, no payment integration).

### 🧾 Reports & Results
- After a draw closes, the system calculates hits for each bet.
- Admins can generate reports of the top 3 winners based on hits.
